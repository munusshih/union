    <div id="content">
        The State of the Union is an annual address by the President of the United States before a joint session of
        congress. In it, the President reviews the previous year and lays out his legislative agenda for the coming
        year.<br><br>
        This dataset contains the full text of the State of the Union address from 1800 <span>(Adams)</span> to 2017 <span>(Trump)</span>. I
        wanted to analyze the tones between different presidents, especially the way they address themselves in the
        speech. Do they use<span> 'our/we', 'I', 'their/them', 'you'</span> pronouns more often over another or not? What does that
        say about their personalities?<br><br>
        The results show that most of the presidents would prefer <span>our/we</span> pronouns over <span>"I"</span>. It is probably because that
        The State of the Union is a united speech of reviews, showing unified perspectives rather than personal heroism.
        However, there are some counterexamples, such as Fillmore in 1850 or Hayes in 1880, where they both mentioned
        <span>"I"</span> way more times than <span>"our/we"</span>.<br><br>
        The Visualization is aimed to represent the numbers of unique words that are used in speeches, the amounts of
        pronouns in each speech, the proportions of them at the same time.
